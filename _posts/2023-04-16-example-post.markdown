## Acatenango Hike

Hiking an extremly steep path through the cloud forest up the volcano Acatenango.  

Constantly facing the active and frequently errupting volcano Fuego.  
After five hours of hiking, we arrived at the base camp at 3,500 metres altitude.

Getting rewarded with a stunning view of the active volcano.
